The file map.html contains the code that loads a map.
This map does a search for the wikipedia articles around the mentioned location and radius.
This map contains features like Use of Google Fusion Tables , Markers, MarkerClusterer and Spatial Queries along with Directions.

As Per the Requirements:
1. Create a Google Maps program to visualize a data set stored in a Google Fusion Table.
		Fusion Table ID : 1mial4XsFwRCY65J0cZI5x7EJtTBycAbCuQQLH4Zh //made public
		
2. You may use the following Fusion Tables. But feel free to find your own data.
		Fusion Table Used : a. Geocoded Wikipedia articles
		
3. Add a directions feature. Allow the user to get directions from an entered address to a selected marker on the map.
		On Clicking a particular Marker, a window appears, where in it displays the information and options called "From Here" and "To Here".
		The direction is then shown to the destination from the mentioned location. The text is also displayed in the panel to the right.
		It also displays an error message if the destination/source is not entered.
		
4. Implement a spatial query feature. Allow the user to enter a street address and search for information within certain distance
		When the User enters a particular city and selects the desired radius from the dropdown, the Wikipedia articles around that region is displayed.
		
5. Implement a marker cluster in your Google Maps program.
		A Marker Clusterer is also implemented as a part of this project. Where clicking on a cluster in the map, gives the group of clusters in that area.
